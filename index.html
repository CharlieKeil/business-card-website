  <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I was born in 1994 In a small oil town called Fort St John in northern British Columbia. I spent fifteen years of my life there and one year in Vancouver. In my early years I always gravitated towards art and was alway told I had a great attention for detail. I moved to Ottawa in 2010 and was able to further develop my skills throughout highschool. After highschool I dabbled in Mechanical Engineering and then decided to go back into the arts. Now I am a second year Graphic Design student at Algonquin College.</p>
    <p>Some of my  hobbies and interests include: Design, Illustration, Fine arts, Photography,  Typography, Web development and design, Snowboarding, and anything Car and Motorcycle related.</p>
